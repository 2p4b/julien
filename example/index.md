Julien, "NoCMS" built for folks like you and me. It gets the job done without any headache. 

#### Why create yet another cms?
I was trying to get a web page up over the weekend, with a simple contact us form, but it required using a php wordpress plugin and start maintaining a yet another php stack, or using hugo and signing up for a subscription service to collect the form data

Most of my clients want a simple webpage and maybe some react with a simple form 
without needing to signup for yet another subscription service or data collection site
just for collecting contact us form data or other simple forms on their respective sites

Though static site generators like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a mailto, will meet needs of most users, I find myself reaching out to other third party services when I needed a simple form, most of which are moving towards a subscription model or clients/users have to pay with their data(Google forms) and I can only subscribe to so many services before i go bankrupt.
